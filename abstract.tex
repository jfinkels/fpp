  % % Foreword %
  %
  % %% Context (anyone - why now?) %%
  %
  % What is the current situation, and why is the need so important?
  %
  Parameterized complexity theory seeks to better understand the resource requirements of multivariate computational problems.
  %
  % %% Need (readers - why you?) %%
  %
  % Why is this relevant to the reader, and why does something need to be done?
  % (Also reference relevant existing work.)
  %
  Until now, researchers have mostly focused on efficient parameterized algorithms for intractable parameterized problems.
  %
  % %% Task (author - why me?) %%
  %
  % What was undertaken to address the need?
  %
  We undertake a comprehensive study of the foundations of parameterized parallel complexity, the computational complexity of efficient and highly parallel parameterized algorithms for inherently sequential parameterized problems.
  %
  % %% Object (document - why this document?) %%
  %
  % What does this document cover?
  %
  This paper provides the definitions, basic intuition, and fundamental theorems underlying the study of parameterized parallel complexity.

  %
  % % Summary %
  %
  % %% Findings (author - what?)
  %
  % What did the work reveal when performing the task?
  %
  We study tradeoffs in time, nondeterminism, and parallelism through the lens of structural complexity theory.
  %
  % %% Conclusion (readers - so what?)
  %
  % What did the findings mean for the audience?
  %
  Most importantly, our results highlight the role of limited nondeterminism in classical complexity theory and its relationship to nondeterminism in parameterized complexity theory.
  %
  % %% Perspective (anyone - what now?)
  %
  % What should be done next?
  We hope this encourages both researchers and practicioners to consider a multivariate approach when determining the complexity of computational problems.
