\section{\texorpdfstring{$\para \NC$}{paraNC} is to \texorpdfstring{$\NC$}{NC} as \texorpdfstring{$\para \WNC$}{paraWNC} is to \texorpdfstring{$\NNC$}{NNC}}

% % Foreword %
%
% %% Context (anyone - why now?) %%
%
% What is the current situation, and why is the need so important?
%
The previous section shows one way of proving that a problem is likely not parallelizable, even in a parameterized sense: proving it complete for $\para \P$.
A highly parallel algorithm for such a problem would imply that every problem that could be solved by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm could be solved by a fixed-parameter parallelizable algorithm, a notion that violates our intuition about the nature of time.
%
% %% Need (readers - why you?) %%
%
% Why is this relevant to the reader, and why does something need to be done?
% (Also reference relevant existing work.)
%
There is another way of proving a problem unlikely to be fixed-parameter parallelizable, one that relies on our intuition about the nature of nondeterminism.
Our intuition is that nondeterministic computation cannot be simulated deterministically by any algorithm that is significantly more efficient than simply enumerating each possible branch of the nondeterministic computation.
%
% %% Task (author - why me?) %%
%
% What was undertaken to address the need?
%
We can use this intuition to provide evidence that an entire family of weighted circuit satisfiability problems is unlikely to be parallelizable in a parameterized sense;
%
% %% Object (document - why this document?) %%
%
% What does this document cover?
%
this section provides formalizes this idea.

% % Summary %
%
% %% Findings (author - what?)
%
% What did the work reveal when performing the task?
%
Specifically, \autoref{thm:ncwnc} proves that $\NC^d = \NNC^d[\omega(\log n)]$ is equivalent to the corresponding collapse of the classes of parameterized problems.
On the way to proving this equivalence, we also prove that the parameterized versions of the natural complete problems in $\NNC^d[\omega(\log n)]$ are complete for the corresponding parameterized complexity classes (\autoref{thm:parawncdcomplete}).
Before getting to those theorems, we of course define the necessary parameterized complexity classes and provide some examples of member problems.
%
% %% Conclusion (readers - so what?)
%
% What did the findings mean for the audience?
%
These complete problems and complexity class collapses validate our intuition that the parameterized complexity classes behave like the classes of problems decidable by algorithms augmented with limited nondeterminism.
%
% %% Perspective (anyone - what now?)
%
% What should be done next?
These results complement similar equivalences from \autocite[Theorem~3.29]{fg06} and \autocite[Theorem~15]{cm14}, as discussed in \autoref{sec:ncwnc} below.
We stop short of providing a general theorem that supercedes all of these theorems.

\subsection{Definition of \texorpdfstring{$\para \WNC$}{paraWNC}}

The $\para \W$ ``operator'' defined in \autocite[Definition~3.1]{est15} applies generically to an arbitrary complexity class as follows.
If $\mathcal{C}$ is a class of decision problems, then $\para \W \mathcal{C}$ is the class of parameterized problems $(Q, \kappa)$ for which there is a $\mathcal{C}$ machine $M$ and computable functions $f$ and $h$ such that $x$ in $Q$ if and only if there is a string $w$ of length $h(\kappa(x)) \log |x|$ such that $M$ accepts on input $(x, 1^{f(\kappa(x))})$ and nondetermistic input $w$; access to the nondeterministic input is two-way.
In a loose sense, for most classes $\mathcal{C}$, deterministic $\mathcal{C}$ is to nondeterministic $\mathcal{C}$ as $\para \mathcal{C}$ is to $\para \W \mathcal{C}$.

When $\mathcal{C} = \NC$ in particular, we get the following equivalent definition.

\begin{definition}[{$\para \WNC^d$}]
  Let $d$ be a natural number.
  A parameterized problem $(Q, \kappa)$ is in the class $\para \WNC^d$ if there are circuit-computable functions $f$ and $h$, and a nondeterministic circuit family $\{C_{n, k}\}$ such that for each string $x$,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $x \in Q$ if and only if $C_{n, k}(x) = 1$, where $n = |x|$ and $k = \kappa(x)$,
  \item $\size(C_{n, k}) \leq f(k) n^{O(1)}$,
  \item $\depth(C_{n, k}) \leq f(k) + \log^d n$,
  \item $\nondet(C_{n, k}) \leq h(k) \log n$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Example problems in \texorpdfstring{$\para \WNC$}{paraWNC}}
\label{sec:rankinwp}

What kind of problems are in the class $\para \WNC$?
Some problems are given in \autocite{est15}, we provide a few more in this section.

\subsubsection{Small generating set problems}

The parameterized semigroup rank problem is in $\para \WNL$ \autocite[Theorem~3.12]{est15}, which is contained in $\para \WNC^2$.
Let us consider the parameterized group rank problem, a restriction of the parameterized semigroup rank problem.
We can show that this problem is in $\para \WL$, which is also in $\para \WNC^2$.

\begin{definition}[$\pgrouprank$]
  \mbox{} \\
  \begin{tabular}{r p{9.2cm}}
    \textbf{Instance:} & finite group $G$ given as a product table, positive integer $k$. \\
    \textbf{Parameter:} & $k$. \\
    \textbf{Question:} & Does $G$ have a generating set of cardinality $k$?
  \end{tabular}
\end{definition}

This problem is highly parallelizable, given that a witness of size $O(k \log n)$ is provided.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:pgrouprank}
  $\pgrouprank$ is in $\para \WL$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  The Turing machine receives $G$ and $k$ as input and a subset $S$ of $k$ group elements as a witness.
  It loops over each element $g$ in $G$ and decides whether $g \in \gen{S}$.
  The machine accepts exactly when all of the subgroup membership tests pass.
  Looping over $n$ elements uses $O(\log n)$ space.
  Deciding whether $g$ is in $\gen{S}$ is the subgroup membership problem, which is in $\SL$, which in turn equals $\L$.
  Thus the overall space usage is $O(\log n)$.
  The size of the witness is $k \log n$, and two-way access is required, since we execute the subgroup membership procedure $n$ times.
  We conclude that this parameterized problem is in $\para \WL$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Weighted circuit satisfiability problems}

Let $\|x\|_1$ denote the Hamming weight (that is, the number of ones) of a binary string.
This problem is the restriction of $\pCSAT$ to bounded depth circuits.

\begin{definition}[$\pNCSAT$]
  \mbox{} \\
  \begin{tabular}{r p{9.2cm}}
    \textbf{Instance:} & Boolean circuit $C$ on $m$ inputs with depth $\log^d m$, natural number $k$. \\
    \textbf{Parameter:} & $k$. \\
    \textbf{Question:} & Is there a binary string $w$ such that $\|w\|_1 = k$ and $C(x) = 1$?
  \end{tabular}
\end{definition}

To prove membership in $\para \WNC^d$, we will use the following \emph{decoder function}.
Since we will also later use its inverse, the \emph{encoder function}, we define it here as well.

\begin{definition}\label{def:coding}
  The \emph{encoder function}, $E_n \colon \{0, 1\}^m \to \{0, 1\}^{\log m}$, is defined by
  \[
  E_m(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    i & \text{if } x \text{ has exactly one 1 at index } i \\
    0^{\log n} & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
  \]
  for each binary string $x$ of length $m$.
  The \emph{decoder function}, $D_m$, is defined as the inverse of the encoder function.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:codingbounds}
  For each natural number $m$, both the encoder and decoder functions are computable by a circuit of size $O(m)$ and depth $O(\log m)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This can be found in, for example, Lemmas~2.5.3 and 2.5.4 of \autocite{savage98}.
\end{proof}

This theorem is an adaptation of \autocite[Lemma~3.3]{cc97lim}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:pkncsatmem}
  For each positive integer $d$, we have $\pNCSAT$ is in $\para \WNC^d$.
  %% Also, the underlying decision problem is in $\NNC^d[\poly]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  %% The underlying decision problem has a straightforward $\NNC^d[\poly]$ algorithm using the depth-universal circuit of \autocite{ch85}, along with a logarithmic depth circuit that enforces the inequality $\|w\|_1 = k$.
  %%The number of nondeterministic bits used by that circuit is $n$, the number of inputs to the circuit $C$, which is bounded above by the size of $C$.
  %%
  %% Membership in $\para \WNC^d$ requires a little more work.
  The algorithm will be composed of several subcircuits.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Let $U$ be the depth-universal circuit \autocite{ch85} for depth $\log^d m$.
  \item Let $D_{m, k}$ be the function defined by $D_{m, k}(w) = D_m(w_1) \lor \dotsb \lor D_m(w_k)$, where $\lor$ denotes bitwise \textsc{or} for strings of length $m$, the binary string $w_i$ is the $i$th block of $w$ of size $\log m$, and $D_m$ is the decoder function (\autoref{def:coding}).
  %% The circuit $D_{m, k}$ interprets its input as $k$ blocks of length $\log m$ each, then outputs the string containing a one at index $i$ exactly when at least one block is the binary encoding of the natural number $i$.
  \item Let $\Delta$ be the function that takes $k$ blocks of $\log m$ bits each as input and evaluates to true exactly when each pair of blocks of size $\log m$ are distinct. For example, if $m = 4$, then $\Delta(0101) = 0$ but $\Delta(1011) = 1$.
  \end{itemize}
  Define the nonuniform, nondeterministic $\NC^d$ circuit family $\{A_{m, k}\}$ that decides $\pNCSAT$ by
  \[
  A_{n, k}((C, k), w) = U(C, D_{m, k}(w)) \land \Delta(w).
  \]
  In other words, $A_{n, k}$ interprets its witness string $w$ of length $k \log m$ as an encoding of a string of length $m$ containing \emph{exactly} $k$ ones (as enforced by $\Delta$), then evaluates the circuit $C$ on that string.

  This algorithm correctly decides the underlying decision problem.
  For each circuit $C$ of size $n$ and each integer $k$,
  \begin{align*}
    (C, k) \in \pNCSAT & \iff \exists x \in \{0, 1\}^m \colon \|x\|_1 = k \text{ and } C(x) = 1 \\
    & \iff \exists w \in \{0, 1\}^{k \log m} \colon (C(D_{m, k}(w)) \land \Delta(w)) = 1 \\
    & \iff \exists w \in \{0, 1\}^{k \log m} \colon (U(C, (D_{m, k}(w))) \land \Delta(w)) = 1 \\
    & \iff \exists w \in \{0, 1\}^{k \log m} \colon A_{n, k}((C, k), w) = 1.
  \end{align*}
  %% The number of nondeterministic bits used by $A_{n, k}$ is of the form $h(k) \log m$ if we choose $h$ to be the identity function.
  If we assume without loss of generality that $m \leq n$ (by padding with useless gates, for example), then the number of nondeterministic bits used is less than $k \log m$, which is of the form $h(k) \log n$.

  For the size and depth bounds, we need to determine the size and depth of the circuits for $U$, $D_{m, k}$, and $\Delta$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The depth-universal circuit $U$ has size $m^{O(1)}$ and depth $O(\log^d n)$, which is $O(\log^d m)$ because we can assume without loss of generality that the size of $C$ is at least the number of its inputs.
  \item
    Decoding a single block of size $\log m$ requires size $O(m)$ and depth $O(\log m)$ by \autoref{lem:codingbounds}.
    Decoding all $k$ blocks of size $\log m$ requires $k$ copies of that subcircuit, along with an \textsc{or} tree for each of the $m$ output bits.
    Thus the size of $D_{m, k}$ is $O(k m + m \log k)$ and the depth $O(\log m + \log k)$.
  \item
    Comparing two binary strings of length $\log m$ for inequality requires $O(\log m)$ size and $O(\log \log m)$ depth.
    Comparing all $\binom{k}{2}$ pairs of blocks and requiring they are all distinct thus requires a circuit of size $O(\binom{k}{2} \log m)$ and depth $O(\log m + \log k)$.
  \end{itemize}
  Hence the overall size of $A_{n, k}$ is of the form $f(k) m^{O(1)}$ and the depth $f(k) + \log^d m$.
  Since we can assume without loss of generality that $m \leq n$, we get size and depth bounds with the appropriate dependence on $k$ and $n$.

  Since we have shown a $\para \WNC^d$ circuit family deciding $\pNCSAT$, we conclude that the problem is in $\para \WNC^d$.
\end{proof}

If we replace $k$ with any function $i(n)$ bounded above by a polynomial in $n$, we get the (already known) membership of the underlying decision problem in $\NNC^d[i(n) \log n]$.
The weight $k$ can be at most the number of inputs to the circuit, which is in turn at most the size of the circuit, so a polynomial upper bound on $k$ suffices to cover all meaningful values of $k$.

\begin{corollary}[{\autocite{cc97lim}}]\label{lem:nncmem}
  Suppose $d$ is a positive integer and $i$ is a circuit-computable function such that $i(n) \leq n^{O(1)}$.
  Then the decision problem $\iNCSAT$ is in nonuniform $\NNC^d[i(n) \log n]$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  The only change we need to make the circuit from the proof of the previous lemma is to add a single \textsc{and} with the result of deciding the inequality $k \leq i(n)$.
  The computation of $i(n)$ can be assumed part of the nonuniformity of the circuit, at which point the comparison requires only logarithmic depth.
  (If we wish the deciding circuit to be uniform, we can require that $i(n)$ be computable in uniform depth $O(\log^d n)$.)
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Weighted formula satisfiability problems}

This technique also provides an alternate proof that parameterized weighted Boolean formula satisfiability problem, denoted $\pFSAT$, is in $\para \WNC^1$, implicit in \autocite[Theorem~3.6]{est15}.
The proof directly implements the decoder function of \autoref{def:coding} as a Boolean formula.

\begin{lemma}[{\autocite[Theorem~3.6]{est15}}]\label{lem:pfsatmem}
  $\pFSAT$ is in $\para \WNC^1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We adapt the ``$k \log n$ trick'' from circuit inputs to formula variables.
  This requires a reimplementation of the decoder function of \autoref{def:coding} as a function on Boolean variables.
  Similar to the proof of \autoref{lem:pkncsatmem}, the algorithm involves composing a decoder and an algorithm for evaluating a Boolean formula, after nondeterministically choosing a witness.
  Again, we use some subcircuits:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Let $U$ be the $\NC^1$ algorithm for evaluating a Boolean formula \autocites{buss87, bcgr92}.
  \item
    Let $M_i$ be the function on $\log m$ that outputs the $i$th minterm of its input variables (for example, $M_4(w_1, w_2, w_3) = w_1 \land \lnot w_2 \land \lnot w_3$).
    This function acts like the decoder in \autoref{lem:pkncsatmem}.
  \item
    Let $R_{m, k}(\phi)$ be the function that replaces each instance of a variable $x_i$ in a Boolean formula $\phi$ on $m$ variables with $\vee_{j = 1}^k M_i(\vec{v}_j)$, where $\vec{v}_j$ denotes the $j$th block of size $\log m$ in a tuple of $k \log m$ new variables $v_1, \dotsc, v_{k \log m}$.
  \item Let $\Delta$ be the function that takes $k$ blocks of $\log m$ bits each as input and evaluates to true exactly when each pair of blocks of size $\log m$ are distinct.
  \end{itemize}
  Define the nonuniform, nondeterministic $\NC^1$ circuit family $\{A_{n, k}\}$ that decides $\pFSAT$ by
  \[
  A_{n, k}((\phi, k), w) = U(R_{m, k}(\phi), w) \land \Delta(w).
  \]
  In other words, $A_{n, k}$ interprets its witness string $w$ of length $k \log m$ as the \emph{encoding of an assignment} to the variables of $\phi$ in which exactly $k$ variables are set to true, then evaluates the formula $\phi$ with respect to the decoded assignment.

  This algorithm correctly decides the weighted Boolean formula satisfiability problem.
  Similar to the proof of \autoref{lem:pkncsatmem}, $\phi$ has a satisfying assignment of weight exactly $k$ if and only if $\phi'$ has a satisfying assignment (of arbitrary weight).
  If we assume without loss of generality that $m \leq n$ (by padding with tautological conjuncts, for example), then the number of nondeterministic bits used is less than $k \log m$, which is of the form $h(k) \log n$.

  The algorithm also has the appropriate size and depth bounds.
  Since each minterm is of size exactly $\log m$ and each variable $x_i$ is represented the disjunction of $k$ such minterms, the new formula $\phi'$ is of size $|\phi| k \log m$, which is just $n k \log m$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Each variable $x_i$ can be replaced in parallel, and within that replacement, each disjunct $M_i(\vec{w}_j)$ can be replaced in parallel as well.
    The circuit that writes $M_i(\vec{w}_j)$ is a circuit of size $O(\log m)$ and depth $O(\log m)$ (for using the index $i$ as a selector in a multiplexer), so $R_{m, k}$ can be implemented by a circuit of size $O(n k \log m)$ and depth $O(\log m)$.
  \item
    The circuit $U$ receives a formula of size $O(n k \log m)$ and an assignment of length $O(k \log m)$.
    Since $U$ is a circuit of size polynomial in its the size of its input, its size is $O((n k \log m)^c)$ for some constant $c$.
    Similarly, its depth is $O(\log^d (n k \log m))$.
  \item As in \autoref{lem:pkncsatmem}, the circuit for $\Delta$ is of size $O(\binom{k}{2} \log m)$ and depth $O(\log m + \log k)$.
  \end{itemize}
  The overall size and depth of the circuit $A_{n, k}$ are therefore of the form $f(k) n^{O(1)}$ and $f(k) + O(\log^d n)$, respectively.

  At this point, we have shown a correct $\para \WNC^1$ algorithm for $\pFSAT$.
\end{proof}

The same proof works for the problems of deciding whether a circuit or a formula has a satisfying assignment of weight \emph{at most} $k$, as well (one could even remove the $\Delta$ subcircuit entirely, but that is not necessary).

\subsection{Completeness in \texorpdfstring{$\para \WNC$}{paraWNC}}

We saw that the parameterized weighted Boolean formula satisfiability problem, $\pFSAT$, is in $\para \WNC^1$ in \autoref{lem:pfsatmem}.
In fact, it is complete for $\para \WNC^1$ under $\para \FO$ many-one reductions \autocite[Theorem~3.6]{est15}.
\todo{Can we use the ``template on top of a verification language'' to prove completeness in complexity classes of decision problems with limited nondeterminism as well?}
The parameterized weighted Boolean circuit satisfiability problem, denoted $\pCSAT$, is the same problem with Boolean circuits instead of Boolean formulas; this problem is complete for $\para \WP$ under $\para \FO$ many-one reductions by a similar proof.
It makes sense to expect, then, that the problems $\pNCSAT$ may be complete for the classes $\para \WNC^d$, for each positive integer $d$.

%% One strategy for proving complete problems for the $\para \WNC^d$ classes might be to adapt the proof of the $\para \WNC^1$-completeness of $\pFSAT$.
%% Since Boolean formulas are equivalent to Boolean circuits of logarithmic depth \todo{add citation}, the $\pFSAT$ can be viewed as $p \dash k \dash \NC^1 \textsc{CSat}$.
%% However, the proof of \autocite[Theorem~3.6]{est15} does not translate directly to the setting of bounded depth circuit satisfiability (their reduction would yield a circuit of depth greater than polylogarithmic in the number of inputs).
In order to prove completeness for these problems, we use the strategy from \autocite[Theorem~3.6]{cc97lim}, which relies on the ``$k \log n$ trick'' (see \autocite[Corollary~3.13]{fg06}, or the origin \autocite{adf95}).
There the authors prove that the decision problem underlying $\pNCSAT$ is complete for $\NNC^d[k \log n]$.
As we will see in the next section (and repeatedly throughout this paper), parameterized complexity and limited nondeterminism in decision complexity are closely related.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:parawncdcomplete}
  For each positive integer $d$, we have $\pNCSAT$ is complete for $\para \WNC^d$ under $\para \NC^1$ many-one reductions.
  %% Also, the underlying decision problem is in $\NNC^d[\poly]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Membership in $\para \WNC^d$ was proven in \autoref{lem:pkncsatmem}.

  Suppose $(Q, \kappa)$ is in $\para \WNC^d$, so there is a nonuniform $\NC^d$ circuit family $\{C_{n, k}\}$ and circuit-computable functions $f$ and $h$ such that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $x \in Q$ if and only if $C_{n, k}(x) = 1$,
  \item $\size(C_{n, k}) \leq f(k) n^{O(1)}$,
  \item $\depth(C_{n, k}) \leq f(k) + O(\log^d n)$,
  \item $\nondet(C_{n, k}) \leq h(k) \log n$.
  \end{itemize}
  On input $x$ of length $n$, let $C_x$ denote the circuit $C_{n, k}$ with $x$ hardcoded as its first $n$ inputs.
  Thus $C_x$ is a circuit with $h(k) \log n$ inputs such that $x \in Q$ if and only if $C_x$ is satisfiable.
  Let $E_{n, k}$ denote the function defined by $E_{n, k}(w) = E_n(w_1) \circ \dotsb \circ E_n(w_{h(k)})$, where $\circ$ denotes string concatenation, $E_n$ is the encoder function of \autoref{def:coding}, and $w_i$ is the $i$th block of size $n$ in the string $w$, for each string $w$ of length $h(k) n$.
  The reduction is then $x \mapsto (C', h(k))$, where $C' = C_x \circ E_{n, k}$.

  The circuit $C'$ is of the correct form to be an input to $\pNCSAT$.
  The size of $C'$ is
  \begin{align*}
    \size(C') & = \size(E_{n, k}) + \size(C_x) \\
    & \leq h(k) \size(E_n) + f(k) n^{O(1)} \\
    & \leq h(k) O(n) + f(k) n^{O(1)}
  \end{align*}
  and the depth
  \begin{align*}
    \depth(C') & = \depth(E_{n, k}) + \depth(C_x) \\
    & \leq \depth(E_n) + (f(k) + \log^d n) \\
    & \leq O(\log n) + f(k) + \log^d n \\
    & \leq f(k) + O(\log^d n).
  \end{align*}
  The number of inputs to $C'$ is $h(k) n$, so we need the size to be polynomial in $h(k) n$ and the depth to be $\log^d (h(k) n)$.
  The size bound is satisfied if we choose $h(k)$ so that $f(k) \leq h(k)$ and the depth bound satisfied if we choose $h(k)$ so that $f(k) \leq \log^d h(k)$, ignoring some constants that can be incorporated into the function $h$.
  We can choose $h$ this way without loss of generality, because choosing a larger $h$ does not affect membership of $(Q, \kappa)$ in $\para \WNC^d$.
  (This does, however, cause the nondeterminism upper bound of the problem $(Q, \kappa)$ to be extremely loose and the dependence on $k$ in the size and depth bounds of $C'$ to be extremely high, but it is technically sufficient.)

  The reduction is a correct many-one reduction between the underlying decision problems.
  Suppose $x \in Q$, so $C_x$ is satisfiable.
  Since $E_n$ is surjective, so is $E_{n, k}$, hence there is a string $w$ (of length $h(k) n$) such that $C'(w) = 1$.
  Furthermore, this string satisfies $\|w\|_1 = h(k)$ since all preimages of $E_{n, k}$ satisfy this equality.%
  \footnote{%
    Technically, we need to guarantee the satisfying input to $C_x$ has no all-zero blocks to make this statement.
    For each parameterized problem $(Q, \kappa)$ there is another equivalent problem that satisfies such a requirement on the witnesses for $Q$ with no change in complexity.%
  }
  Therefore, $C'$ has a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight exactly $h(k)$.
  For the converse, suppose $C'$ has a satisfying assignment $w$ of weight exactly $h(k)$.
  Then there is a satisfying assignment of length $h(k) \log n$ for $C_x$, namely $E_{n, k}(w)$.
  Therefore, $x$ is in $Q$.

  The reduction is $\para \NC^1$-computable.
  The size of the circuit computing the reduction is simply the size of the output, which is $\size(C') + \size(h_k)$, where $h_k$ denotes the circuit computing $h$ on inputs of size $k$.
  Both addends are of the form $f'(k) n^{O(1)}$ for some circuit-computable function $f'$.
  The depth of the circuit computing the reduction is dominated by the depth of the $h_k$, which is bounded above by $f'(k) + \log n$ for some function $f'$.
  Thus the size and depth requirements for the reduction are met.
  Finally, if $R$ denotes the reduction and $\kappa'$ denotes the parameterization for $\pNCSAT$,
  \[
  \kappa'(R(x)) \leq \kappa'((C', h(\kappa(x)))) = h(\kappa(x)).
  \]
  Since $h$ is circuit-computable by hypothesis, the reduction meets the parameterization bound.

  Since we have shown a correct $\para \NC^1$ many-one reduction from an arbitrary parameterized problem in $\para \WNC^d$ to $\pNCSAT$, we conclude that $\pNCSAT$ is complete for the class.
\end{proof}

As in \autoref{lem:nncmem}, if we replace $k$ with any function $i(n)$ bounded above by a polynomial in $n$, we get the (already known) completeness of the decision problem $\iNCSAT$ in the complexity class $\NNC^d[i(n) \log n]$.
This is a slight improvement, since \autocite[Theorem~3.6]{cc97lim} proves that the problem of deciding whether a circuit has a satisfying assignment of weight at most $i(n)$ is complete for $\NNC^d[i(n) \log n]$ for all $d \geq 2$ under logarithmic space many-one reductions.

\begin{corollary}[{\autocite[Theorem~3.6]{cc97lim}}]\label{cor:nnccomplete}
  Suppose $d$ is a positive integer and $i$ is a circuit-computable function such that $i(n) \leq n^{O(1)}$.
  Then $\iNCSAT$ is complete for $\NNC^d[i(n) \log n]$ under nonuniform $\NC^1$ many-one reductions.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Membership was proven in \autoref{lem:nncmem}.
  The proof of completeness is identical to that of the previous theorem, replacing $k$ with $i(n)$.
  (If we wish to have uniform completeness, we can require that $i(n)$ be computable in uniform depth $O(\log n)$.)
\end{proof}

This technique also gives us an alternate proof of the completeness $\pFSAT$ \autocite[Theorem~3.6]{est15}.
However, we can prove only completeness under the $\para \NC^1$ reduction instead of the tighter $\para \FO$ reduction.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:pfsatcomplete}
  $\pFSAT$ is complete for $\para \WNC^1$ under $\para \NC^1$ many-one reductions.
  %% Also, the underlying decision problem is in $\NNC^1[\poly]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Membership in $\para \WNC^1$ was proven in \autoref{lem:pfsatmem}.

  To prove hardness, it suffices to show a $\para \NC^1$ reduction from $p \dash k \dash \NC^1 \textsc{CSat}$ to $\pFSAT$, since the circuit problem is complete for $\para \WNC^1$ by the previous theorem.
  The reduction is $(C, k) \mapsto (\phi, k)$, where $\phi$ is the standard reduction for logarithmic depth circuits to polynomial size Boolean formulas.
  This reduction recursively replaces each subcircuit with its corresponding formula, using the input gates of the circuit as the variables for the formula.
  Since the depth of the (fan-in 2) circuit is $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number if inputs to $C$, the size of the formula is $2^{O(\log n)}$, which is polynomial in $n$.
  Furthermore, since the variables appearing in the formula are exactly the input gates of the circuit, the circuit has a satisfying assignment of weight $k$ if and only if the formula has a satisfying assignment of weight $k$.
  Finally, the reduction is computable by circuit of size $O(|\phi|)$ and depth $O(\depth(C))$, so it is computable in $\NC^1$ \todo{someone verify this}.
  Since furthermore the parameter is unchanged by the reduction, the $\NC^1$-computable function trivially induces a $\para \NC^1$ reduction.
\end{proof}

Now we have a full interpolation for the inclusion chain
\[
\para \WNC^1 \subseteq \para \WNC^2 \subseteq \dotsb \subseteq \para \WP,
\]
via the chain of parameterized reductions between corresponding complete problems
\[
\pFSAT \leq p \dash k \dash \NC^2 \textsc{CSat} \leq \dotsb \leq p \dash \textsc{CSat}.
\]
Whether the $\pNCSAT$ problems are complete under $\para \FO$ many-one reductions remains open.

Finally, we extend \autocite[Corollary~3.7]{est15} using this new family of complete problems.
That theorem states that $\NC^1 = \P$ implies $\W[\SAT] = \W[\P] (= \para \WP)$, so we wish to generalize it to allow for an interpolation between $\NC^1$ and $\P$.
This connects a collapse in parameterized complexity classes to one in classical complexity classes.

\begin{corollary}
  For each positive integer $d$, if $\NC^d = \P$, then $\W[\NC^d \SAT] = \W[\P] (= \para \WP)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  By definition, $\W[\NC^d \SAT]$ is the closure of $\pNCSAT$ under $\para \P$ many-one reductions and $\W[\P]$ is the closure of $\pCSAT$ under $\para \P$ many-one reductions.
  If $\NC^d = \P$, then there is a $\para \P$ many-one reduction from $\pCSAT$ to $\pNCSAT$ (because $\pCSAT$ is now in $\NC^d$).
  Thus every parameterized problem that reduces to $\pCSAT$ also reduces to $\pNCSAT$.
  We conclude that $\W[\NC^d \SAT] = \W[\P]$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Does \texorpdfstring{$\para \NC$}{paraNC} equal \texorpdfstring{$\para \WNC$}{paraWNC}?}
\label{sec:ncwnc}

The main theorem in this section, \autoref{thm:ncwnc}, provides evidence that the parameterized complexity classes $\para \NC$ and $\para \WNC$ are distinct.
Compare it with the following similar theorems (here $\beta$ indicates one-way access to the witness as opposed to $\W$, which indicates two-way access).
\begin{itemize}
\item $\para \P = \para \WP$ if and only if $\P = \NP[\omega(\log n)]$ \autocite[Theorem~3.29]{fg06}.
\item $\para \L = \para \beta \L$ if and only if $\L = \NL[\omega(\log n)]$ \autocite[Theorem~15]{cm14}.
\end{itemize}
\todo{Can we generalize all of these theorems?}

This lemma is an adaptation of \autocite[Lemma~3.24]{fg06}.
It is the ``opposite'' of \autoref{lem:upperinverse}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:lowerinverse}
  Suppose $d$ is a positive integer.
  For each increasing, circuit-computable function $f$, there is a function $i_{f, d}$ such that
  \[
  f(i_{f, d}(n)) \leq \min(n, \log^d n)
  \]
  for each $n \geq f(1)$.
  Furthermore, $i_{f, d}$ is nondecreasing, unbounded, and circuit-computable.
  (We call $i_{f, d}$ the ``lower inverse'' of $f$.)
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Define $i_{f, d}$ by
  \[
  i_{f, d}(n) = \max\{ j \in \mathbb{N} \, | \, f(j) \leq \min(n, \log^d n) \}.
  \]
  For the boundary case where $n$ is smaller than $f(1)$, define $i_{f, d}(n) = 1$.
  It is straightforward to prove that this function is nondecreasing and unbounded.
  (The integer $d$ must be greater than zero to guarantee $i_{f, d}$ is unbounded.)

  To compute $i_{f, d}$, we use the fact that $f$ is increasing to perform a binary search on the values $f(1), \dotsc, f(\min(n, \log^d n))$ to determine the largest $j$ such that $f(j) \leq \min(n, \log^d n)$.
  In the worst case, there will be at most $\log n$ comparison subcircuits, each requiring a computation of $f$, so the overall depth of the circuit computing $i_{f, d}$ is $O(\depth(f) \log n)$ and the size is $O(\size(f) \log n)$.
\end{proof}

This theorem is an adaptation of \autocite[Theorem~3.29]{fg06}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:ncwnc}
  Suppose $d$ is a positive integer.
  $\para \NC^d = \para \WNC^d$ if and only if there is a circuit-computable, nondecreasing, unbounded function $i$ such that $\NC^d = \NNC^d[i(n) \log n]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  First we prove the reverse implication.
  Assume $\NC^d = \NNC^d[i(n) \log n]$, for some $i$.
  Since $\pNCSAT$ is complete for $\para \WNC^d$ by \autoref{thm:parawncdcomplete}, it suffices to show that this problem is in $\para \NC^d$, which necessitates the claimed collapse.
  By \autoref{cor:nnccomplete}, the problem $\iNCSAT$ is in $\NNC^d[i(n) \log n]$, which means it is also in $\NC^d$ by assumption.
  If $(Q, \kappa)$ denotes $\pNCSAT$ and $i(n) \dash Q$ denotes $\iNCSAT$, then the former is in $\para \NC^d$ by \autoref{cor:sprself}.

  Now we prove the forward implication.
  Assume $\para \NC^d = \para \WNC^d$.
  By \autoref{thm:parawncdcomplete}, the parameterized problem $\pNCSAT$ is in $\para \WNC^d$, which means it is also in $\para \NC^d$ by assumption.
  Suppose the circuit family witnessing its membership in $\para \NC^d$ has size $f(k) n^{O(1)}$ and depth $f(k) + \log^d n$ for some circuit-computable function $f$.
  Assume without loss of generality that $f$ is increasing.
  Choose $i$ to be the ``lower inverse'' function $i_{f, d}$ guaranteed by \autoref{lem:lowerinverse}.
  Since $\iNCSAT$ is complete for $\NNC^d[i(n) \log n]$ by \autoref{cor:nnccomplete},it suffices to show that this problem is in $\NC^d$, which necessitates the claimed collapse.
  If $(Q, \kappa)$ denotes $\pNCSAT$ and $i(n) \dash Q$ denotes $\iNCSAT$, then the latter is in $\NC^d$ by \autoref{cor:reducetoself}.
\end{proof}

As a corollary, we can relate the completeness of parameterized or decision problems to collapses in decision or parameterized classes, respectively.

\begin{corollary}
  Suppose $d$ is a positive integer.
  The following are equivalent.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\pNCSAT$ is in $\para \NC^d$.
  \item There is a circuit-computable, nondecreasing, unbounded function $i$ such that $\iNCSAT$ is in $\NC^d$.
  \item $\para \NC^d = \para \WNC^d$.
  \item There is a circuit-computable, nondecreasing, unbounded function $i$ such that $\NC^d = \NNC^d[i(n) \log n]$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Is \texorpdfstring{$\para \WNC$}{paraWNC} in \texorpdfstring{$\para \P$}{paraP}?}
\label{sec:wncp}

The previous section demonstrates that it is unlikely that $\para \WNC$ is contained in $\para \NC$.
By relaxing the collapses in \autoref{thm:ncwnc}, we show that it is also unlikely that $\para \WNC$ is contained in $\para \P$.
However, the collapses in this theorem are weaker.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:wncp}
  Suppose $d$ is a positive integer.
  $\para \WNC^d \subseteq \para \P$ if and only if there is a circuit-computable, nondecreasing, unbounded function $i$ such that $\NNC^d[i(n) \log n] \subseteq \P$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  The proof is identical to that of \autoref{thm:ncwnc}, replacing $\para \NC^d$ and $\NC^d$ with $\para \P$ and $\P$, respectively.
  It uses versions of \autoref{cor:sprself} and \autoref{cor:reducetoself} with similar changes.
\end{proof}

An alternate approach is to demonstrate related collapses in parameterized complexity classes.
We extend \autocite[Corollary~3.8]{est15}, which states that $\para \WNC^1 \subseteq \para \P$ if and only if $\para \P = \W[\SAT]$.
As before, we wish to generalize this equivalence to allow for an interpolation between $\NC^1$ and $\P$.

\begin{theorem}
  Suppose $d$ is a positive integer.
  $\para \WNC^d \subseteq \para \P$ if and only if $\para \P = \W[\NC^d \SAT]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  If $\para \WNC^d \subseteq \para \P$, then $\pNCSAT$ is in $\para \P$, so the closure of $\pNCSAT$ under $\para \P$ many-one reductions is contained in the closure of $\para \P$ under the same reductions, which is just $\para \P$.
  Thus $\para \P = \W[\NC^d \SAT]$.

  If $\para \P = \W[\NC^d \SAT]$, then every parameterized problem that reduces to $\pNCSAT$ under $\para \P$ many-one reductions is in $\para \P$.
  Since $\pNCSAT$ is complete for $\para \WNC^d$ under $\para \NC^d$ many-one reductions, every problem in $\para \WNC^d$ reduces to $\pNCSAT$ under $\para \NC^d$ many-one reductions, and hence under $\para \P$ many-one reductions as well.
  Thus $\para \WNC^d \subseteq \para \P$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Does \texorpdfstring{$\para \WNC$}{paraWNC} equal \texorpdfstring{$\para \WP$}{paraWP}?}
\label{sec:wncwp}

\begin{conjecture}
  For each positive integer $d$, if $\para \WNC^d = \para \WP$, then $\NC^d = \P$.
\end{conjecture}
\begin{justification}
  $p \dash k \dash \textsc{CSat}$ is $\para \WP$-complete and $p \dash \textsc{FSat}$ is $\para \WNC^1$-complete \autocite[Theorem~3.6]{est15}.
  A reduction from the former to the latter would be very surprising.
\end{justification}
