% % Summary %
%
% %% Findings (author - what?)
%
% What did the work reveal when performing the task?
We show the existence of a $\P$-complete problem in $\para \NC$ (the circuit evaluation problem parameterized by depth \autoref{thm:cvpdepth}) and a $\P$-complete problem not in $\para \P$, unless $\NC = \P$ (the ``small'' circuit evaluation problem \autoref{thm:psce}).
We prove that $\para \NC = \para \WNC$ exactly when $\NC = \NNC[i(n) \log n]$ \autoref{sec:ncwnc}.
